Clearing

|------|------|-------|
| The removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software recovery utilities. | Clearing is an essential process for safeguarding data and system integrity, ensuring that access is restricted to authorized personnel and thwarting cyber threats.​ | The process of Clearing refers to making data or sensitive information on a storage medium (such as a hard disk, disk, or other memory devices) unrecoverable or inaccessible without the need to completely destroy the medium. Clearing typically involves overwriting the stored data using methods that render the data lost and inaccessible, but it does not reach the level of completely destroying the storage medium. |

| The process that makes data on a storage device unreadable by standard means, without permanently deleting it, may involve overwriting the data with non-sensitive information to prevent access to the original data. This approach is typically used when the device is to be reused within the same organization and does not require complete data destruction. To fully destroy data in a way that it cannot be recovered, a process called "sanitization" is used, which is more secure​ | the permanent deletion of data from storage devices. This process ensures that the data is unrecoverable by ordinary means. Why is clearing important? Security To prevent sensitive data from being accessed by unauthorized individuals. Compliance To adhere to data protection regulations such as GDPR. Trust To assure clients and customers that their data has been securely disposed of. NIST standards provide guidelines for secure data clearing methods. These standards ensure that data is erased completely and irrecoverably. In essence, clearing is a crucial step in data security and is often mandated by law for organizations handling sensitive information. | The process of "clearing" as referenced by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) involves the verification and validation of data or transactions within various systems to ensure they are conducted according to the established standards. This validation process ensures that the transaction or data complies with security or accuracy requirements. In some cases, clearing may involve clearing or erasing data used in transactions (e.g., in money transfers or financial market transactions) to ensure that the relevant information has been reviewed and updated to be safely utilized in compliance with the standards set by NIST. Overall, "clearing" in the context of NIST is typically linked to ensuring the integrity and correctness of data or confirming the processing of transactions in systems that are managed according to NIST's security standards |
